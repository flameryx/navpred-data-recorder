- MISSING EPISODES
Too often episodes are missing. This could be caused, because the robot start position and the goal position are so close to each other
that the robot reaches it before the data recorder can record the simulation. Since the dat recorder is activated on the ros clock 
callback, if the robot reaches the goal before the clock callback is activated, then nothing will be recorded and we will have no data 
for that specific episode.

- DWA ERROR 
Sometimes an error occurs that messes up the whole planning of the path. It has something to do with base_footprint.
When this happens, the planner won't work at all for any of the episodes.
